          Welcome to the help page for Join, your guide to using our kanban
          project management tool. Here, we'll provide an overview of what Join
          is, how it can benefit you, and how to use it.
        </p>

        <h2>What is Join?</h2>

        <p>
          Join is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a
          group of dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp
          at the Developer Akademie.
        </p>

        <p>
          Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective
          method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize
          efficiency (or flow). Join leverages the principles of kanban to help
          users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual
          interface.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is important to note that Join is designed as an educational
          exercise and is not intended for extensive business usage. While we
          strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot
          guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or other
          aspects of quality regarding Join.
        </p>

        <h2>How to use it</h2>

        <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use Join:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <h3>Exploring the Board</h3>
            When you log in to Join, you'll find a default board. This board
            represents your project and contains four default lists: "To Do",
            "In Progress", "Await feedback" and "Done".
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Creating Contacts</h3>
            In Join, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to
            the "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in the
            required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned
            tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Adding Cards</h3>
            Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards.
            Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the
            appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in
            the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Moving Cards</h3>
            As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on
            the board by dragging and dropping the card from one list to
            another.
          </li>

          <li>
            <h3>Deleting Cards</h3>
            Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list
            or delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it from the
            board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action
            is irreversible. Remember that using Join effectively requires
            consistent updates from you and your team to ensure the board
            reflects the current state of your project. Have more questions
            about Join? Feel free to contact us at [Your Contact Email]. We're
            here to help you!
          </li>
        </ol>
