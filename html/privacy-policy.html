                General Information on the Legal Bases for Data Processing on

              </h3>
              <p>
                If you have consented to data processing, we process your
                personal data based on Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR or Art. 9(2)(a) GDPR if
                special categories of data are processed according to Art. 9(1)
                GDPR. In the event of explicit consent to the transfer of
                personal data to third countries, the processing is also based
                on Art. 49(1)(a) GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of
                cookies or to access information on your device (e.g., via
                device fingerprinting), data processing is additionally carried

                If your data is required for the fulfillment of a contract or
                for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, we process
                your data based on Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR. Furthermore, we process
                your data if it is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation based
                on Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR. Data processing may also be based on our
                legitimate interest according to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The relevant
                legal bases for each individual case are provided in the
                following paragraphs of this privacy policy.

                In the course of our business operations, we cooperate with
                various external parties. This may require the transfer of
                personal data to these external parties. We only share personal
                data with external parties if this is necessary for the
                fulfillment of a contract, if we are legally obligated to do so
                (e.g., data transfer to tax authorities), if we have a
                legitimate interest under Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, or if another legal
                basis allows data sharing. When using data processors, we only
                share personal data of our customers based on a valid data
                processing agreement. In the case of joint processing, a joint
                processing agreement is concluded.

              <p>
                You have the right to have data that we process automatically
                based on your consent or in fulfillment of a contract delivered
                to you or a third party in a commonly used, machine-readable
                format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to
                another controller, this will only be done to the extent
                technically feasible.

              <p>
                This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and to
                protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders
                or inquiries you send to us as the site operator. You can
                recognize an encrypted connection by the change in the address
                line of the browser from “http://” to “https://” and by the lock
                symbol in your browser line.
              </p>
              <p>
                If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to
                us cannot be read by third parties.

                Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you
                have the right at any time to free information about your stored
                personal data, its origin and recipients, and the purpose of
                data processing and, if applicable, a right to correction or
                deletion of this data. For this purpose, as well as for further
                questions on the subject of personal data, you can contact us at
                any time.

              <h3>Right to Restrict Processing</h3>
              <p>
                You have the right to request the restriction of the processing
                of your personal data. To do this, you can contact us at any
                time. The right to restrict processing exists in the following
                cases:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by
                  us, we usually need time to verify this. For the duration of
                  the verification, you have the right to request the
                  restriction of the processing of your personal data.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the processing of your personal data happened/is happening
                  unlawfully, you can request the restriction of data processing
                  instead of deletion.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If we no longer need your personal data but you need it to
                  exercise, defend, or assert legal claims, you have the right
                  to request the restriction of the processing of your personal
                  data instead of deletion.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you have lodged an objection under Art. 21(1) GDPR, a
                  balance must be struck between your interests and ours. As
                  long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail,
                  you have the right to request the restriction of the
                  processing of your personal data.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                If you have restricted the processing of your personal data,
                this data—apart from being stored—may only be processed with
                your consent or for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal
                claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or
                legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the
                European Union or a member state.
